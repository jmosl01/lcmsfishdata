  The lcmsfishdata package is a companion to the LUMA R package and contains multiple tables of processed LCMS-based untargeted metabolomics data from fish livers associated with the WLSSD 2014 21 d reproductive study (https://doi.org/10.1002/etc.3228). It is used to provide reproducible examples for users of LUMA who want to learn how to use LUMA to process LCMS-based untargeted metabolomics data within the R environment. The raw data files are not provided with lcmsfishdata due to size constraints but will be made available from the author upon request.
