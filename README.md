# lcmsfishdata

  The `lcmsfishdata` R package is a companion data package to `LUMA` and contains tables of processed LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics data. Installing `lcmsfishdata` enables many reproducible examples of various `LUMA` functions and self-contained modules. The raw data files associated with these processed data tables are not available at this time.

## Installation

You can install development version of `lcmsfishdata` from GitHub with the following:

```r
# requires devtools to install
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)

# install from repository
install_github('USEPA/lcmsfishdata')
library(lcmsfishdata)
```


## Example
The documentation within the `LUMA` R package contains multiple examples that utilize the tables in the `lcmsfishdata` R package. Vignettes are also available for testing typical `LUMA` workflows.
